## About Me

I received the BSc degree in computer science from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China in 2021. Currently, I am a PhD student (supervised by Prof. Xin Geng) in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Southeast University, China. My main research interests include machine learning and data mining, especially in weakly supervised learning. Additionally, I am exploring the application of techniques from weakly supervised learning to AI alignment, focusing on developing alignment methods in scenarios where data is missing or of low quality.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** Partial Label Learning, Multi-Label Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, AI Alignment
